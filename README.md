# Korean Computer Scientist Search (KCSS)
KCSS was created by Junho Han, Seunghyun Lee and Jinwoo Shin at Algorithmic Intelligence Laboratory, KAIST. This project aims to provide a digital library on major computer science conferences and identify korean authors from their English name. Korean names are classified by a LSTM model, and search results for Korean names are not perfect. If you could notify us Korean authors that do not appear in the search result, we will incorporate them.
